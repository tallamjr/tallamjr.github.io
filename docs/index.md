## Bio

<img src="./assets/images/profile-crop.png" style='border:0px solid #000000' alt="profile pic" align="right" width="300" height="300">

I am currently a PhD student at the Centre for Doctral Training in Data Intensive Science at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, UCL, supervised by Professor Jason McEwen, Professor Ofer Lahav and Dr. Denise Gorse. My PhD is in the emerging field of Astroinformatics, which is an interdisciplinary field of study involving the combination of astrophysics, astronomy, data science and machine learning.

My research focus centres around applying Machine Learning methods for Photometric Supernova classification. For a further overview of my research interests and specific research topics I am involved with, see my research page.

I am a polyglot-programmer whose current languages of choice are Scala, Rust and Python See my blog for a more personal look into my world.
