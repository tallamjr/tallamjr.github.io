A lot of the really amazing engineering is taking place in companies, and what's great is that they
love to talk about it! Here is my collection of awesome engineering blogs...

This post was inspired by David Zhang's [awesome-engineering-blogs](https://github.com/crispgm/awesome-engineering-blogs) and the general ![awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg) movement, www.awesome.re

The idea is that this list will grow (and possibly shrink) over time as I discover more engineering
blogs, and I will use this list as a reference for myself.

Much of the list is the same as David's, but I have added a couple, namely Databricks and NVIDIA's
engineering blog, and removed some to make it more digestible. There is a very substantial list of
[Software Engineering blogs](https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs) by Kilim Choi which I
recommend looking into for a more complete list.
