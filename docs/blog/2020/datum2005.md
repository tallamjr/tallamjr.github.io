### What is KIP-500?

KIP refers to the Kafka-Improvement-Proposal, much like PEP (Python Enhancement Proposals)
developers can influence the development of Kafka by proposing ideas. KIP-500 is motivated by:
>Currently, Kafka uses ZooKeeper to store its metadata about partitions and brokers, and to elect a
>broker to be the Kafka Controller.  We would like to remove this dependency on ZooKeeper.  This
>will enable us to manage metadata in a more scalable and robust way, enabling support for more
>partitions.  It will also simplify the deployment and configuration of Kafka.

This is neatly visualised by the image below:

Zookeeper has served Kafka well for many years, but the drive to develop a self-contained <a

present at any of its meetings to make the proceedings of that meeting valid.">quorum</a> controller
has been on the cards for some time. Before we go into details of the latests news, let's first
breakdown what this means and explain a few concepts for the uninitiated.

### What is Raft?

RAFT is a consensus protocol that helps maintain state among a set of workers. Zookeeper has their
own implementation of a consensus protocol called Zookeeper Atomic Broadcast Protocol (ZAB).

There has recently been an interesting paper to evaluate the best consensus protocol
