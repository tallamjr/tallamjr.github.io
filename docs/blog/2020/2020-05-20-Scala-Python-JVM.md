Calling compiled Scala code inside the JVM from Python using PySpark

<!--more-->

There is no doubt that Java and Scala are the de-facto languages for Data Engineering, whilst Python
is certainly the front runner for language of choice with Data Scientists. Spark; a framework for
distributed data analytics is written in Scala but allows for usage in Python, R and Java.
Interoperability between Java and Scala is a no briner since Scala compiles down to Java byte code,
but call Scala from Python is a little more involved, but the process is very simple.

The code used in this post builds upon the code used in a previous post and has the standard maven
directory layout. To have a closer look, it can be found under `code/posts/2020-05-20-Scala-Python-JVM`

We will be calling `simple.SimpleApp.hello()` function to print `"Hello, World!"`.


The simple Scala we will use is the following:

```bash
$ cat -n src/main/scala/simple/SimpleApp.scala

 1	package simple;
 2
 3	object SimpleApp {
 4	  def hello(): Unit = {
 5	    println("Hello, Wolrd")
 6	  }
 7	}

```

This will then be compiled and packaged using `sbt` to created a `.jar` file that can be included in
the running JVM instance when launching Spark. Thus, after running:

```bash
$ sbt clean compile package

[success] Total time: 0 s, completed 21-May-2020 13:18:26

```

We obtain `target/scala-2.12/simpleapp_2.12-1.0.jar` which is supplied to Spark like so:

```bash
$ spark-submit --driver-class-path target/scala-2.12/simpleapp_2.12-1.0.jar simpleSpark/main.py

```

`simpleSpark/main.py` is the where the `pyspark` code lives that will be calling the Scala function,
let's have a look into that file:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .master("local[*]") \
    .appName("simpleSpark") \
    .getOrCreate()

sc = spark.sparkContext
sc.setLogLevel("ERROR")


def logLevel(sc):
    # REF: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25193488/how-to-turn-off-info-logging-in-spark
    log4jLogger = sc._jvm.org.apache.log4j
    log4jLogger.Logger.getLogger("org").setLevel(log4jLogger.Level.ERROR)
    log = log4jLogger.LogManager.getLogger(__name__)
    log.warn("Custom WARN message")


logLevel(spark)


print(spark.range(5000).where("id > 500").selectExpr("sum(id)").collect())

sc._jvm.simple.SimpleApp.hello()

```

There is a bit of boilerplate to get the session started and some customisation with logging going
on but the key lines of code are:

```python
...
 8  sc = spark.sparkContext
...
25  sc._jvm.simple.SimpleApp.hello()
```

The resulting output after running `spark-submit` is:

```bash
$ spark-submit --driver-class-path target/scala-2.12/simpleapp_2.12-1.0.jar simpleSpark/main.py
