In this post I walk through the steps of how one can set up a standalone Python
project to have it's version set by git tags alone. I will also walk through how one can achieve
this with a Scala project within the same repository.

Releasing software, whether it be a MAJOR, MINOR or PATCH update, often requires one to bump
versions in several files. This can cause files/packages to be out of sync if there are a few files that

```python
print(f"Numpy: {np.__version__}")

def somefunction(col: String)

val mate = Int 5
```
# <a name="matlab"></a>MATLAB
