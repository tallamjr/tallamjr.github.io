In a past life I worked on [efficient machine
learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06178) for problems in
Astrophysics and some of the [big-data challenges for handling alert streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10185) from
the [Vera Rubin telescope ðŸ”­](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_C._Rubin_Observatory). This led to follow-up work on efficient model
deployment for [low-latency high-throughput
inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08951).

Following my PhD I kept with the theme of efficient data processing and
efficient deep learning with my current research. While previous focused in the
domain of Astrophysics/Astronomy, now this mix of efficient data processing and
efficient machine learning is geared to generally improving AI deployment
strategies for embedded systems/resource constrained environments â€” ranging from
phones, routers, microcontrollers and more recently FPGAs â€” where the
overarching problem statement is: _How can we optimise a solution for a given
task in terms of latency, power consumption and size (be that RAM usage or space
on disk)._

Below is a light touch of some areas of focus...

#### 1. A.I. Compilers for Hardware Agnostic Deployment

This covers a broad range of topics including Model Compression (Quantization,
Pruning, etc.) Graph Optimisation and Embedded System Design i.e.
Hardware/Software Co-design.

#### 2. Efficient Machine Learning and Efficient Data Processing

This looks at efficient algorithms for computer vision tasks, such as
efficient Image and Video Reconstruction and Image and Video Compression. This
also includes efficient architectures and the use of spare data representations
for optimising the full data pipeline. This is complimented by
research into Query Optimisation and Distributed System Design for Query
Planning of structured and unstructured data.
