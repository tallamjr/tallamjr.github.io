In a past life I worked on [efficient machine
learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06178) for problems in
Astrophysics and some of the [big-data challenges for handling alert streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10185) from
the [Vera Rubin telescope ðŸ”­](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_C._Rubin_Observatory). This led to follow-up work on efficient model
deployment for [low-latency high-throughput
inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08951).

Following my PhD I kept with the theme of efficient data processing and
efficient deep learning with my current research. While previous focused in the
domain of Astrophysics/Astronomy, now this mix of efficient data processing and
efficient machine learning is geared to generally improving AI deployment
strategies for embedded systems/resource constrained environments â€” ranging from
phones, routers, microcontrollers and more recently FPGAs â€” where the
overarching problem statement is: _How can we optimise a solution for a given
task in terms of latency, power consumption and size (be that RAM usage or space
on disk)._

Below is a light touch of the 3 main pillars of my current research...

### 1. A.I. Compilers for Hardware Agnostic Deployment

### 2. Efficient Machine Learning

Model compression, Model Optimisation, Efficient Algorithms.
