# Release Versioning with git tags

__In this post I walk through the steps of how one can set up a standalone Python
project to have it's version set by git tags alone. I will also walk through how one can achieve
this with a Scala project within the same repository.__

Releasing software, whether it be a MAJOR, MINOR or PATCH update, often requires one to bump
versions in several files. This can cause files/packages to be out of sync if there are a few files that
need updating.

## Why?


```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

with open('requirements.txt') as f:
    requirements = f.read().splitlines()

__FALLBACK_VERSION__ = "0.1"

setup(
    name="option3",
    use_scm_version={
        "root": ".",
        "relative_to": __file__,
        "fallback_version": __FALLBACK_VERSION__},
    setup_requires=['setuptools_scm>=3.5.0'],
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=requirements
)

```

- [SBT-Native-Packager](#native)
- [Docker](#docker)

```python
print(f"Numpy: {np.__version__}")
```

Say if I said something here

```bash
$ echo "Hello World!"
```

```scala
println("hello")
def somefunction(col: String)

val mate = Int 5
```
# <a name="matlab"></a>MATLAB
