Over the past 12 months or so I have been learning and playing with Apache Spark. I went through the
brilliant book by Bill Chambers and Matei Zaharia, *Spark: The Definitive Guide*, that covers Spark
in depth and gives plenty of code snippets one can try out in the `spark-shell`. Whilst the book is
indeed very detailed and provides great examples, the datasets that are included for you to get your
hands on are on the order of `Mb`'s (with the exception of the `activity-data` dataset used for the
Streaming examples).

There is no doubt that Java and Scala are the de-facto languages for Data Engineering, whilst Python
is certainly the front runner for language of choice with Data Scientists. Spark; a framework for
distributed data analytics is written in Scala but allows for usage in Python, R and Java.
Interoperability between Java and Scala is a no briner since Scala compiles down to Java byte code,
but call Scala from Python is a little more involved, but the process is very simple.

## [Mirroring Public Repositories on Github, Privately]

__This post walks through the steps involved if you want to fork a public Github repository,

These steps were inspired from this guide of '[Mirroring a
repository'](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository#mirroring-a-repository) on Github documentation

<!-- Two weeks ago, Material for MkDocs Insiders shipped a brand new search plugin, -->
<!-- yielding massive improvements in usability, but also in speed and size of the -->
<!-- search index. Interestingly, as discussed in the previous blog article, we only -->
<!-- scratched the surface of what's now possible. This release brings some useful -->
<!-- features that enhance the writing experience, allowing for more fine-grained -->
<!-- control of what pages, sections and blocks of a Markdown file should be indexed -->
<!-- by the built-in search functionality. -->

<!-- __This is the story of how we managed to completely rebuild client-side search, -->

<!-- The search of Material for MkDocs is by far one of its best and most-loved -->
<!-- assets: multilingual, offline-capable, and most importantly: _all client-side_. -->
<!-- It provides a solution to empower the users of your documentation to find what -->
<!-- they're searching for instantly without the headache of managing additional -->
<!-- servers. However, even though several iterations have been made, there's still -->
<!-- some room for improvement, which is why we rebuilt the search plugin and -->
<!-- integration from the ground up. This article shines some light on the internals -->
<!-- of the new search, why it's much more powerful than the previous version, and -->
<!-- what's about to come. -->
