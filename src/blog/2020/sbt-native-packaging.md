For this short post, I have created a "simpleApp" which is a simple "Hello, World!" application in
Scala. The example code for this post is in the standard maven directory layout, i.e:

```bash
.
├── build.sbt
├── project
│   ├── build.properties
│   ├── plugins.sbt
│   ├── project
│   └── target
├── src
│   ├── main
│   │   └── scala
│   │       └── simple
│   │           └── SimpleApp.scala
│   └── test
│       └── scala
│           └── simple
└── target

```

and with the `SimpleApp.scala` code looking like so:

```python
package simple;

object SimpleApp {
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  println("Hello, world!")
}
}

```

Assuming you are familiar with `sbt`, one can use the following to compile the program to
Java byte code and run:

```bash
$ cd simpleApp
$ sbt clean compile run

```

Ok, great. We have a running Scala application built and run with `sbt`. But the point of this post
is that we want to run a native binary...

To achieve this `sbt-native-packager` plugin is used. Before we use it, one must ensure the plugin
is "installed" in the `project/plugins.sbt` file like so:

```bash
$ cat -n project/plugins.sbt

 1  logLevel := Level.Warn
 2
 3  // for autoplugins
 4  addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-native-packager" % "1.6.1")
```

Furthermore we need to ensure we have set the right variables in the `build.sbt` file such as:

```bash
$ sed -n 1,7p build.sbt

name := "SimpleSBTProject"

version := "1.0"

scalaVersion := "2.12.8"

enablePlugins(JavaAppPackaging)
```

With these two modified files and the project directory set up the way it is, we are ready to create
our binary using the `stage` directive for `sbt`.

```bash
$ sbt clean compile stage

```

Using `stage` creates a new set of files, found in the `target/universal` directory:

```bash
$ tree target/universal/
target/universal/
├── scripts
│   └── bin
│       ├── simplesbtproject
│       └── simplesbtproject.bat
└── stage
    ├── bin
    │   ├── simplesbtproject
    │   └── simplesbtproject.bat
    └── lib
        ├── org.scala-lang.scala-library-2.12.8.jar
        └── simplesbtproject.simplesbtproject-1.0.jar

5 directories, 6 files

```

Notice it creates a Unix and Windows version.

Now let's run it...

```bash
$ ./target/universal/stage/bin/simplesbtproject

Hello, world!
```

Success, we can run a single "binary" for our application. I put binary in quotation marks there
because it is not exactly a binary file that is created, and one would still need Java installed on
the system, but it allows a user to run a command like the above which is better suited for
production settings.

Ok, now that we can do this, "What about making a Docker image!" I hear you cry. This can also be
done with some minor additions to the `build.sbt` file with:

```bash
$ sed -n 9,18p build.sbt

enablePlugins(DockerPlugin)

// change the name of the project adding the prefix of the user
packageName in Docker := "tallamjr/" +  packageName.value
//the base docker images
dockerBaseImage := "java:8-jre"
//the exposed port
dockerExposedPorts := Seq(9000)
//exposed volumes
dockerExposedVolumes := Seq("/opt/docker/logs")

```

With this in place, we can use `publishLocal` to create a docker image locally, which, when built we
will run.

Just to convince ourselves a new docker images is created `docker images` reveals only other
projects after doing a `docker system prune -a`:

```bash
$ docker images

REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
machcoll_bluebird   latest              140ca65afae2        2 months ago        1.15GB
machcoll-img        dev-1bea126         38298723afa1        2 months ago        1.01GB
nats-metrics-img    master-9a39559      3af43d2f4bd7        2 months ago        1.1GB

```

Running `sbt publish:Local` creates the docker image for us (I have excluded much of the output for
brevity)

```bash
$ sbt publish:Local
...
[info] Built image tallamjr/simpleapp with tags [1.0]
[success] Total time: 53 s, completed 21-May-2020 11:46:06
```

Now when we do `docker images` again we should see our new docker image:

```bash
$ docker images

REPOSITORY           TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
tallamjr/simpleapp   1.0                 6eb32a8b2939        About a minute ago   317MB
machcoll_bluebird    latest              140ca65afae2        2 months ago         1.15GB
machcoll-img         dev-1bea126         38298723afa1        2 months ago         1.01GB
nats-metrics-img     master-9a39559      3af43d2f4bd7        2 months ago         1.1GB
java                 8-jre               e44d62cf8862        3 years ago          311MB

```

Let's test this:

```bash
$ docker run tallamjr/simpleapp:1.0

Hello, world!
```

So there we have it! `sbt-native-packager` is able to also publish to a docker registry and in
addition to standard scripts like the one above, one can also [create other formats](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/gettingstarted.html#create-a-package)

    universal:packageBin - Generates a universal zip file
    universal:packageZipTarball - Generates a universal tgz file
    debian:packageBin - Generates a deb
    docker:publishLocal - Builds a Docker image using the local Docker server
    rpm:packageBin - Generates an rpm
    universal:packageOsxDmg - Generates a DMG file with the same contents as the universal zip/tgz.
    windows:packageBin - Generates an MSI
