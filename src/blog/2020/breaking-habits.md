Some years ago, I decided to make a couple changes to how I write my commits and organise my git
logs. This post goes over how breaking a couple habits has vastly improved my software development
and data science workflow.

For the uninitiated, `git` is a source code versioning system created by the legendary Linus
"`linux`" Torvalds. In a previous post <INSERT-HERE> I mentioned how influential `vim` has been on
my software engineering journey, `git` is on an equal footing there, if not more so, as learning
`git`, and learning it well, has trulely liberated me in becoming the developer I am today and
allows me to grow.

"Right, OK, yeah yeah" I hear you cry; "what was this _one_ habit" you were on about!?"

# 1. Dropping `-m`

Going from ~~`git commit -m`~~ to just `git commit`

# 2. Embrace `rebase`

# 3. Branching with Purpose

* `issue/123/desc`
* `feature/456/desc`
* `feature/456/issue/789/desc`

Helping to remember, might be considered cosmetic like the rebase. But doing this has changed how I
think about, plan ahead for code changes or updates.
