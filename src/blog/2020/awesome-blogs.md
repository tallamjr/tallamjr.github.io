# Awesome Engineering Blogs

__This post was inspired by David Zhang's [awesome-engineering-blogs](https://github.com/crispgm/awesome-engineering-blogs) and the general ![awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg) movement, www.awesome.re__

The idea is that this list will grow (and possibly shrink) over time as I discover more engineering
blogs, and I will use this list as a reference for myself.

Much of the list is the same as David's, but I have added a couple, namely Databricks and NVIDIA's
engineering blog, and removed some to make it more digestible. There is a very substantial list of
[Software Engineering blogs](https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs) by Kilim Choi which I
recommend looking into for a more complete list.
