*Here I walk through the steps of installing the MATLAB, R and Julia kernels for Jupyter
notebooks. Also discussed are some of the gotchas I encountered along the way.*

Jupyter notebooks are an amazing way of keeping track of programming pipelines
and for learning concepts through programming. It is also a great way to
recall how you may have done something before, or solved a problem previously [@bishop2006pattern]

I have been using Jupyter notebooks (*previously know as the IPython notebook*)
for a while but only for use with Python 2.7 programming language. Following a
brilliant Coursera course on [Julia Scientific Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/julia-programming/),
I discovered that there has been a push to make these notebooks agnostic to
language. There are several kernels available at the moment for a multitude of languages
including Julia, R, Ruby and so on, a full list of which can be found [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages).
This post will talk though the steps involved to install the MATLAB, R and Julia kernels.


- [MATLAB](#matlab)
- [R](#r)
- [Julia](#julia)


## **MATLAB**<a name="matlab"></a>

MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is ubiquitous in the world of scientific computing and is a many
engineering and physics students only connection to programming. The brilliant
abstraction away from the low-level implementation of [LAPACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK) under the hood with
a nice high level interface make MATLAB a very powerful and useful tool. Combine
that with the Jupyter notebook and we now have a way of expressing complex
mathematical concepts and doing compute numerical methods in an easy to read
manner.

To get started one needs to have MATLAB installed on their local machine. MATLAB
is propriety software from the mathworks company but if you are affiliated with a
university a license should be easy to come by. After the binary is installed,
one needs to install the MATLAB engine for Python, instructions for downloading
can be found
[here](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html).
The system requirements for these installs can be found [here](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/system-requirements-for-matlab-engine-for-python.html),
however, on the system requirement website, it states Python 3.5 is supported,
but I found this not to be the case (*14-11-2016*) as I encountered the following error under a 3.5 environment:

```less
OSError: MATLAB Engine for Python supports Python version 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4, \
but your version of Python is 3.5
```

Therefore, it was decided to create a new environment to play it safe under
Python 3.4 using [conda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) like so;

```less
conda create -n py34 python=3.4 anaconda
source activate p34
```

Then, open up MATLAB and type in:

```bash
cd "matlabroot/extern/engines/python"
python setup.py install
```

This will install the MATLAB engine for Python. Following that we need to ensure
a few dependencies are also installed.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyter
pip install pymatbridge
pip install matlab_kernel
python -m matlab_kernel install
```

One may encounter the following [error](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/297),
this can be resolved by doing the following:

```bash
conda remove pyzmq && pip install pyzmq
```

Once all of these steps have been completed, you should be able to start a new
Jupyter notebook with a MATLAB kernel like so:


```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then in the notebook, select MATLAB from the 'New' menu in the top right hand
corner. Alternatively, from the command line, one can simply run:

```bash
jupyter console --kernel matlab
```

## <a name="r"></a>**R**

R, the successor to S, is a statical programming language. Unlike MATLAB, R is
an open source language that has now been around for over 20 years. Over that
time, it established itself as the language of choice for mathematical
statistician and is widely used today. Although slower that the other two
languages mentioned here, it is a highly expressive language and the DataFrame
concept is one that has influences many other modern languages (Pandas - Python,
DataFrames - Julia etc).

The R kernel is fairly simple to download and install via **conda** package
manager, and I would recommend going through this useful
[article](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer/jupyter-and-conda-r).
Unfortunately I discovered that article after the fact, which meant I had to jump
over a few hurdles in attempting to get things working on my machine. I will go
through the steps I took installing without using **conda** package manager as it
might be useful for people not using **conda**, but I would recommend if you are,
the definitely follow the article I have listed above.

Since I
already has **R** installed on my machine, I didn't feel it necessary to
re-download **r-essntials** from **conda** so I followed the instructions on the
[IRKernel GitHub readme](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel) which instructed
me to install the relevant dev tools from within `R` like so:

```r
install.packages(c('repr', 'IRdisplay', 'crayon', 'pbdZMQ', 'devtools'))
devtools::install_github('IRkernel/IRkernel')
IRkernel::installspec()  # to register the kernel in the current R installation
```
This produced the following error:
```less
Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) :
Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with given CA certificates
```
According to
[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31293325/r-install-github-fails)
this can be easily resolved by setting;
```r
library(httr)
set_config( config( ssl_verifypeer = 0L ) )
```
at the **R** prompt.

After installing I received the following error:

```bash
$ which R
/Users/me/anaconda/bin/R

$ /Users/me/anaconda/bin/R
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libpcre.1.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/me/anaconda/lib/R/lib/libR.dylib
  Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap: 5
```
This is another issue that can be resolved by looking at this
[SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38467653/r-is-broken-with-dyld-library-not-loaded-rpath-libpcre-1-dylib)
post.

I was able to search for the *libpcre.1.dylib* file by using the brilliant
**find** command like so:


```bash
find / -iname "libpcre.1.dylib"
```

Alternatively one can use [*fzf*](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) fuzzy finder
by changing directory to **/** and running **fzf**. Once inside the program,
simply type: **libpcre.1.dylib** and it
should search for you (this may take a while)

Finally, the last step was to make Jupyter *see* the newly installed kernel by
entering the following withing **R**:

```r
# in R 3.3
IRkernel::installspec(name = 'ir33', displayname = 'R 3.3')
# in R 3.2
IRkernel::installspec(name = 'ir32', displayname = 'R 3.2')
```
To ensure this is system-wide, set user to **FALSE**:
```r
IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)
```
When this is linked you should be off and away and read to use **R** in Jupyter
notebooks.

## Julia <a name="julia"></a>

Julia is a relatively new programming language designed to be a modern scientific
programming language for the 21st century.

[Here](http://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started.html) is a good guide to
get up and running quickly.

Julia was definitely the easiest out of the three kernels mentioned here. All
that is required is a Julia to be [downloaded](http://julialang.org/downloads/)
at version 0.4 or greater on your laptop and to run the
following commands from within Julia:

```python
Pkg.add("IJulia")
```
Then:
```python
using IJulia
notebook()
```
will open up a new tab in your default browser.

There were a few gotcha I did encounter, the main one being [trouble with several
plotting packages](https://github.com/tbreloff/Plots.jl/issues/258) with
Julia.0.5.0 (14-11-2016). I reverted back to Julia 0.4.6
and everything seems to work. I am sure this is only a temporally issue and will be
resolved soon.

Another hiccup once might have may relate to this [issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/297) of the kernel failing to
start (Note, this is the same issue mentioned above for the MATLAB kernel)

```bash
conda remove pyzmq
pip install pyzmq
```

## Final Comments.

I have focused on installing the kernels I felt most useful for *Scientific
Computing*, however a list of other kernels can be found
[here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages). Jupyter
project is doing wonders in helping many people learn programming and also the
research community with sharing code and methodology. I hope this can continue and
if you have read this and also think it's awesome, you can find out more on
their [website](http://jupyter.org/). Since Jupyter is an open source project
you can always contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia), or in
other ways through [donations!](http://jupyter.org/donate.html)
